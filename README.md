# `signer`
## What?
`signer` is a CLI tool to label certificates quickly and efficiently. You need to provide it with three inputs:
* a CSV file with the *names* of certificate recipients;
* the PNG file of the certificate template including any signatures added by representatives of the endorsing organisations;
* the path to a *truetype font* (`.ttf`) or *open type font* (`.otf`) file of the font to be used to label the certificates.

## Why?
* No need for an internet connection.
* It's quick and efficient.
* Avoid the risk of exposing the recipients' personal information on an online platform.
* No limits on how many certificates you can sign. Most online platforms have a paltry free tier.
